Rule Title:  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that designated personnel are notified if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.

STIG ID: RHEL-07-020040  Rule ID: SV-86599r2_rule  Vul ID: V-71975
Severity: CAT II

ACTION: Verify the operating system notifies designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.

Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed and notify specified individuals via email or an alert.

COMMAND: Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:
# yum list installed aide

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Error: No matching Packages to list

If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system.

ACTION: Check for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that executes AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The commands used in the example will use a daily occurrence.

COMMAND: Check the cron directories for a crontab script file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:
# ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 32 Jul 1 2011 aide

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
No ouput was received from the above command!

COMMAND:
# grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
/etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * /root/aide
/var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * /root/aide

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
No ouput was received from the above command!

ACTION: AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the cron job uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity run as in the following example:

COMMAND:
# more /etc/cron.daily/aide

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s centos1.localdomain - Daily aide integrity check run root@sysname.mil

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
No ouput was received from the above command!

POTENTIAL FINDING:
If the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule Title:  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must enable SELinux.

STIG ID: RHEL-07-020210  Rule ID: SV-86613r3_rule  Vul ID: V-71989

Rule Title:  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must use a reverse-path filter for IPv4 network traffic when possible on all interfaces.

STIG ID: RHEL-07-040611  Rule ID: SV-102353r1_rule  Vul ID: V-92251
Severity: CAT II

COMMAND: Verify the system uses a reverse-path filter for IPv4:
# grep net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
No ouput was received from the above command!

POTENTIAL FINDING:
If net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter is not configured in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory, is commented out, or does not have a value of 1, this is a finding.

COMMAND: Check that the operating system implements the accept source route variable with the following command:
NOTE: Modified command for cleaner output
# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

POTENTIAL FINDING:
If the returned line does not have a value of 1, this is a finding.

Rule Title:  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must use a reverse-path filter for IPv4 network traffic when possible by default.

STIG ID: RHEL-07-040612  Rule ID: SV-102355r1_rule  Vul ID: V-92253
Severity: CAT II

COMMAND: Verify the system uses a reverse-path filter for IPv4:
# grep net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
No ouput was received from the above command!

POTENTIAL FINDING:
If net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter is not configured in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory, is commented out, or does not have a value of 1, this is a finding.

COMMAND: Check that the operating system implements the accept source route variable with the following command:
# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

Rule Title:  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must have a host-based intrusion detection tool installed.

STIG ID: RHEL-07-020019  Rule ID: SV-102357r1_rule  Vul ID: V-92255
Severity: CAT II

ACTION: Ask the SA or ISSO if a host-based intrusion detection application is loaded on the system. Per OPORD 16-0080, the preferred intrusion detection system is McAfee HBSS available through the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).
If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as SELinux, this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.

COMMAND: Examine the system to determine if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is installed:
# rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
No ouput was received from the above command!

COMMAND: Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system:
# ps -ef | grep -i “hipclient”

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
root     20183 17539  0 17:08 pts/1    00:00:00 grep -i “hipclient”

NOTE: If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion detection system:
# find / -name <daemon name>
Where <daemon name> is the name of the primary application daemon to determine if the application is loaded on the system.

Determine if the application is active on the system:
# ps -ef | grep -i <daemon name>

POTENTIAL FINDING:
If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding.

If no host-based intrusion detection system is installed and running on the system, this is a finding.

Rule Title:  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence is disabled in the GUI.

STIG ID: RHEL-07-020231  Rule ID: SV-104673r1_rule  Vul ID: V-94843
Severity: CAT I

ACTION: Verify the operating system is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed.

COMMAND: Check that the ctrl-alt-del.target is masked and not active in the GUI with the following command:
# grep logout /etc/dconf/local.d/*

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
logout=''

***COMMAND OUTPUT on centos1***:
grep: /etc/dconf/local.d/*: No such file or directory
No ouput was received from the above command!

If logout is not set to use two single quotations, or is missing, this is a finding.
